##################### Storm Breakers V2.0 - 09/2023 #################################
Shoreline effects implementation :
- Addition of a Terrain field in the Ocean Controller component to activate the shoreline effects.
Wave model updates :
- Wave height is reduced near the shoreline to simulate breaking.
- Breaking speed and torque are increased as the wave height is reduced to simulate shore breaking.
- Group speed is not anymore a function of the intensity but always half the wave celerity, might impact the aspect of a calm sea.
Water shading updates : 
- Implementation of the ground color scattering near shoreline.
- More accurate reflections and color of the surface. Might need to adjust the water color when updating.
- Improved shading of the underwater water surface.
- Particles culled underwater.
Visual effects updates : 
- Implementation of the breaking waves visual effects near shoreline. The waves break as their height is reduced to simulate shore breaking.
- Modifiable light occlusion for the sea foam burst particles of the Water Interaction VFX graph.
Audio effects updates : 
- Implementation of the breaking waves audio effect near shoreline. Roughly sync with the visual effects.
- Fixed bug for the breaking wave audio to make it more sync with the VFX and physics.
Physics update : 
- No possible uses of the job system when using shoreline effects.
New component implementation : 
- Water Effects to make visual and audio effects without the physics.
