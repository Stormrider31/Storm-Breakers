Welcome to the Storm Breakers repository ! 

Storm Breakers is an Unity package to make epic ocean simulation, featuring a unique wave model, realistic breaking waves with visual, audio and physical effect, an extra-documented buoyancy physics adjustable for any gameplay, a scalable splash visual effect synchronized to procedural audio, and a dynamically textured water with realistic rendering.

I developed it myself full time for a year and sold it in the Unity Asset Store as a self entrepreneur. Now this period of self entrepreneur is over and I’m back to a regular job, so I can’t maintain and update the asset anymore and this is why I open source the package !

In the repository you’ll find the manual to start with. You’ll need Unity 2021+ with URP and VFX graph package installed to use Storm Breakers. For support you can contact me by email to lysandre.creations@gmail.com
